                <p>After about a year of experimenting I found myself drawn most to Game and Mobile Development, from C# scripting in Unity Game Engine, to .NET MAUI framework, to creating compelling user interfaces in React and React Native.</p>
                <p>My continuing goal is to learn and grow in these areas, and to create applications that are not only functional, but also visually appealing and user friendly.</p>
